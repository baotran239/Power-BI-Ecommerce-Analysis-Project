# III. Design thinking approach
## Step 1. Empathize 
### 5W-1H

| **Where and when will our stakeholders see the dashboard?** | In the meeting, in the presentation session or anywhere that they have to make decisions |

| **How will our stakeholders see the dashboard to solve their business objectives?** | They have to see the overall performance then zoom into divided layers like customers, services, etc. |

### Empathy map
| Category | Description |
|----------|------------|
| **Thinking and feeling** <br> What does the user/customer think and feel? | The business performance fluctuates, and they wonder about the reasons behind it. <br> When they present, their superiors/subordinates will ask them why in details. <br> They feel confused and hard to find the insights. |
| **Seeing** <br> What does the customer/user see? | They see the overall business picture with different kinds of reasons behind, they cannot see the exact reasons that lead to that business situation. |
| **Saying and doing** <br> What does the customer/user say? | "We need to be more data-driven" <br> They seek for data and visualization that supports their decision-making process. |
| **Pains** <br> What are the biggest problems and challenges? | Insufficient data and information may lead to inefficient solutions. |
| **Gains** <br> What are the opportunities and benefits? | Key insights, unmet needs, straight-to-the-point strategies, data-driven solutions. |

### Northstar metrics
| **Question** | **Answer** |
|-------------|-----------|
| **What VALUE you want to measure?** | Sales, Average deal size, Orders, Repeated customers |
| **WHEN the value DELIVERY SUCCESS?** | When these two metrics reach its maximum value. |
| **WHY do you choose this metric?** | - **Sales revenue** shows the total monetary value generated, reflecting profitability and financial health. <br> - **Average deal size** provides insights into which products are driving revenue growth. Companies can use this information to adjust their product offerings, pricing strategies, and sales tactics to focus on higher-value opportunities. <br> - **Order** indicates transaction volume, providing insights into customer demand, purchase frequency, and conversion rates. <br> - **Repeated customers** provides insights into customer loyalty, satisfaction, and the effectiveness of the company's products or services. By monitoring and improving the rate, companies can enhance customer satisfaction, increase revenue, and strengthen their competitive position in the market, which drives long-term business growth. |

### Point of view

- Target High-Value Regions: Focus on SP, RJ, and MG with:
  - Localized marketing campaigns.
